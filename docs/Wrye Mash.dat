    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>Overview</b></span> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The interface is divided into five tabs: Utilities, Installers, Mods,
        Saves and Screenshots. Each of these&nbsp; is in turn divided into a
        list and a details view. </li>
      <li>Commands are accessed through the menus which can also be invoked by
        right-clicking on item or a column heading and also by left clicking on
        the menubar (on the top) or certain buttons.</li>
      <li>There is also a Morrowind Launch button, a settings button and a help
        button at the left side of the status bar (among other buttons covered
        later).</li>
      <li>Finally also note that Polemos' fork of Wrye Mash can be installed in
        any directory.</li>

    <a name=" ManageTextureReplacers"><b> Manage Texture Replacers</b></a>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <b>Setup</b>
    <ul>
      <li> &nbsp; Create a directory called "Replacers" in your Data Files
        directory.</li>
      <li> &nbsp; Unpack/unzip the replacer package that you want to use into
        the Replacers directory. The name of the directory will be the name of
        the replacer. E.g., "E-Icons Blue Star", or "Redoran, Carnajo" or
        "Redoran, Lady Rae".</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>The replacer's directory structure can be one of two forms:</b></p>
    <p>Just like the Data Files directory structure:</p>
    <p>Replacers</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob's Replacement Set</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Icons (if you have icons)</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meshes (if you
      have meshes)</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Textures (if you have textures)</p>
    <p>Just the textures (for texture replacers only):</p>
    <p> Replacers</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E-Icons, Blue Star</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dds files</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Redoran, Lady
      Rae</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dds files</p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);"><b>Note that most texture
          replacement packs have the second form.</b></span></p>
    <p> <b>Usage</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp; Go to Mods tab, click "Replacers..." in "Settings" menu -- this
        will bring up a checkbox list of the available replacers.</li>
      <li>&nbsp; Checking a replacer will apply it. (Large replacer collections
        may take a while to apply.)</li>
      <li>&nbsp; Unchecking a replacer will remove it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>Switch Between Save Profiles</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Go to Saves tab and Profiles menu.</li>
      <li> Choose Edit... to add, rename, remove profiles.</li>
      <li> Choose a profile to switch to it. Current savegames and Morrowind.ini
        will be archived, and the new profile's savegames and Morrowind.ini will
        be loaded.</li>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> <b>General Advice</b></span><br>
      <b> </b></p>
    <p><b>Run Repair All </b></p>
    <dl>
      <dd>Run Repair All on old save files -- this will often find problems to
        fix.</dd>
      <dd> Run Repair All once in a while after editing Master lists. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p><b> Use Duplicate</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Before making major changes to a save file, create a duplicate and
        make the changes on it. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Features</b><br>
      <b> </b></p>
    <p><b>Manage Mod Files and Load List </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Select load mods from a list that can be sorted by: File Name,
        Modification date, Size, Mod Author, Load Order, Selection State and
        file type (Esm/Esp).</li>
      <li> Select mods by loads lists which you define. E.g., define a Bethesda
        Mods list, or an LGNPC or Astarsis Heads list.</li>
      <li> Hide rarely used mods. (Yes, there's an Unhide command too!)</li>
      <li>Delete and Duplicate Mods.</li>
      <li> Edit file name, modification date, author, description and master
        list.</li>
      <li> Automatically reset modification dates after file has been modified.
        (This substantially reduces doubling problems.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Manage Save Games </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> View a list of your save games sorted by: File Name, Save Name,
        Player Name,</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Current Cell, Load Status (see below).</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Delete, Duplicate and Hide Save Games.</li>
      <li> Edit file name, Save Name and master list.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Reduce/Eliminate Doubling </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> See potential doubling before it happens. (Status boxes in save game
        and master lists.)</li>
      <li> Automatically reset modification dates.</li>
      <li> Update save game files to handle changes to the masters that it
        depends on and to the current load list.</li>
      <li> Repair References in existing files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Browse Mod Documents</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Browse documents for all mods with the <a href="#DocBrowser">Doc
          Browser</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Run Additional Commands </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> View File Statistics. See the number and size of record types in any
        file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Create Your Own Utilities </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Wrye Mash provides libraries and an interface that make it
        (relatively) easy to define new save and file munching utilities and
        make them through the Wrye Mash interface.</li>
      <li> You can also define your own command line utilities for munching on
        data files.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Modify Anything </b></p>
    <p><i> Because the entire source code is available (or soon will be), and
        because no special tools are required, you can modify whatever you like.
        Of course, making modifications that don't break the program requires
        care, but some things are relatively easy and safe to modify</i></p>
    <p><b>Context Menu structure.</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Status icons and highlight colors.</li>
      <li> Toolbar/launcher buttons.</li>

    <p><i>The Installers tab provides a mod package installer facility (called
        Bain). It makes mod installation simpler, and perhaps more importantly,
        it mades mod UN-installation simple and safe. It's also useful for
        resolving resource file conflicts between different mods. Bain has been
        backported from an old version of Wrye Bash -- hence the name "Bain",
        aka Bash Installers. (Yes, I probably should call it "Main", but that
        would be too boring.) If you're familiar with Timeslip's OBMM or MWMM,
        then Bain is fairly similar, but has some substantial advantages (and
        some disadvantages) compared to them. For a comparison, search the web
        for Bash vs. OBMM.</i><br>

    <p><b> Here's a brief getting started guide. You may have to read sections
        further down before this section makes full sense.</b><br>
      <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> </b></p>
    <p><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Terminology: Package</b><br>
      <i> A "package" is a collection of esps, esms and/or resource files.
        Everything listed under the Installers tab is a package. Packages can be
        either archive files in (zip, 7z or rar format) or directories (aka
        Projects).</i></p>
    <p> <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Initialization</b>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you first visit the Installers tab after starting Mash, Bain will
        need to go through an initialization process. If you've done this
        before, and no new packages are installed, and the machine is "warm",
        then it will take on the order of ten seconds. </li>
      <li> However, if you have just added a bunch of packages, then Bain will
        take longer to intitialize, since it will need to scan all new/modified
        packages.</li>
      <li> In particular, the first time you start Bain, it will take a long
        time (on the order of three to ten minutes) to initialize. Enjoy your
        coffee break. :D</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Reducing Init Times</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li> You can disable Bain entirely by unchecking "Enabled" in the
        "Settings" menu on the Installers tab. (Note that this does not erase
        previously stored info. I.e. it's safe to disable Bain and then later
        re-enable it if you prefer.)</li>
      <li> You can choose to "Avoid on Startup" (again from "Settings" menu).
        This will cause Mash to try to avoid the Installers tab when it starts
        up. And since Bain won't initialize until you visit the Installers tab,
        you'll save a bit of time if you weren't planning on visiting it anyway.</li>
    </ul>
    <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> <b>Install Directory</b> </span>
    <ul>
      <li> As noted below, Bain looks for packages in the Morrowind\Installers
        directory. Easiest way to get started with Bain is to just grab all your
        old mod archives and move them to the Installers directory. Then return
        to the Installers directory to see Bain's evaluation. </li>
      <li> If you're a modder with existing project directories, you can move
        those to the Installers directory too.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> Reviewing Package Status</b><br>
      <i> </i></p>
    <p><i>Some packages may be green, but most (even ones that you have
        previously installed) will likely be red. (Even if you have installed a
        package, Bain's Doc File Sweeping means that some files will be in
        unexpected places. </i></p>
    <ul>
      <li> For each package, you can select it, and then review its details in
        the Debug text box. In particular, look for Missing and Overridden
        files.</li>
      <li> You can install a package as desired (though you may want to change
        their order first.) </li>
      <li> For complex packages, you will likely want to configure their
        sub-packages before activating them.</li>
      <li>For packages with unrecognized structure (grey checkbox and name),
        you'll need to restructure the package's directories and files to
        something more like what Bain expects before you can install them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> Overview</b><br>
      <i> </i></p>
    <p><i>Bain will search for and display packages from the (new)
        Morrowind\Installers directory. Mods (either archives or projects) can
        then be installed or uninstalled, and their status can be reviewed in
        the details pane on the right. </i></p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>Checkmarks</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Installed packages will be marked with a "+".</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> Icon Colors</b><br>
      <i> </i></p>
    <p><i>Icon colors indicate the degree to which the package is synchronized
        with the Morrowind\Data Files directory:</i></p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p> <b><img src="images/checkbox_green_inc.png" alt="">Green</b>: Package
      is fully synced. Note that a package can be green even if it is not
      "Active". E.g. if you have two identical packages and one is (fully)
      installed, then it will be green and checked. But the identical package
      will also be green -- since it too is fully synced with the data
      directory.</p>
    <p><b><img src="images/checkbox_red_inc.png" alt="">Red</b>: Some files in
      the package are missing from the data directory.</p>
    <p> <b><img src="images/checkbox_orange_inc.png" alt="">Orange</b>: All
      package files are present in the data directory, but some esps/esms are
      not identical. (E.g. another package installed an alternative version of
      that file, or the user modified the file after installation.)</p>
    <p> <b><img src="images/checkbox_yellow_inc.png" alt="">Yellow</b>: All
      package files are present in the data directory, but some resource files
      are not identical. (E.g. another package installed an alternative version
      of that file, or the user modified the file after installation.)</p>
    <p> <b><img src="images/checkbox_white_inc.png" alt="">White</b>: This is
      relatively rare. It just means that the package is configured in a way
      that it has no files to install. This can happen for complex packages
      where none of the sub-packages are checked.</p>
    <p> <b><img src="images/checkbox_grey_inc.png" alt="">Grey</b>: This
      indicates that the package has a structure that Bain does not recognize,
      and so cannot install. </p>
    <p> <b><img src="images/checkbox_red_x.png" alt="">Red X</b>: The package
      is corrupt and/or incomplete. You'll likely see this for packages that you
      are currently downloading into the Installers directory. </p>

    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Text Colors</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Blue</b>: Indicates a package with sub-packages. The files to be
        installed, and thus the install state of the package will depend on
        which sub-packages you have activated.</li>
      <li> <b>Grey</b>: This indicates that the package has a structure that
        Bain does not recognize, and so, cannot install. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Text Background</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Orange</b>: Indicates that the install is dirty. This will occur
        for packages for which the configuration has been altered (either by
        altering active sub-packages and esmps, or by altering the package
        itself). This can be repaired by running Anneal or Anneal All.</li>
      <li> <b>Yellow</b>: Indicates that the package has "underrides" i.e. some
        of its installed files should be overridden by higher order packages.
        This may happen after reordering mods that have already been installed.
        It can be repaired by running Anneal or Anneal All.</li>
      <li><b>Grey</b>: Indicates that some files present in the package will not
        be installed. This is usually due to a complex structure that is only
        partially handled by Bain, but can also be due to having files that Bain
        refuses to install (exe's, dlls, sub-archives, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Package Details</b></span></p>
    <p><i>Details for the currently selected package will be show on the right.
        There are (currently) three fields here:</i></p>
    <p><b>Info Tabs</b><br>
      <i> The tabs at the top display several types of information relevant to
        the current mod. Note that much of this information is dependent on the
        install status of the mod and sometimes it's order.</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>General</b>: Shows summary info and the files to be installed --
        as determined by sub-package, esp/m, voice filtering, etc.</li>
      <li> <b>Matched</b>: Shows files which are identical to current data
        directory files.</li>
      <li> <b>Missing</b>: Files which are missing from the data directory.</li>
      <li> <b>Mismatched</b>: Files which are present in the data directory,
        but which aren't identical to the package's version of those files.</li>
      <li> <b>Conflicts</b>: Shows which other packages will conflict the
        current package and for what files. Note that if a given file is
        mismatched, but the mismatch isn't due to other packages, then it won't
        appear. This report can be modified to show inactive conflicts and/or
        lower order conflicts through Package Header Commands.</li>
      <li> <b>Underridden</b>: Shows packages which should be overridden, but
        are not, due to install order errors. This can be corrected by running
        Anneal or Anneal All.</li>
      <li> <b>Dirty</b>: Shows files which the package previously installed,
        but which now should be removed or altered due to a reconfiguration of
        the package. Dirty files can be cleared by running Anneal or Anneal All.</li>
      <li> <b>Skipped</b>: Shows which files in the package were skipped by
        Bain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Sub-Packages</b></p>
    <p><i>This will be blank unless the package has sub-packages. You can
        determine which of these to install simply by checking the ones you
        want. Note that sub-packages are installed in the order they appear. So
        if different subinstallers have different versions of the same file,
        then the subinstaller that is later in the list (and active) will win.</i></p>
    <p><b>Esp/m Filtering</b><br>
      <i> This tab can be used to filter out specific esps and esms from a
        packages. This is intended for use with packages that provide alternate
        and optional mods. Note that Esp/m filtering is applied after
        sub-package filtering. E.g. it may be easier to turn off a sub-package
        entirely rather than disable individual espms from it.</i></p>
    <p><b>Comments</b><br>
      <i> This is a field where you can enter comments about the package. Useful
        for keeping track of what the package is supposed to do, etc. Do note
        that if you uninstall the installer you also delete permanently the
        comment.<br>
      </i></p>
    <p><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Package Structure</b><br>
      <i> Bain recognizes three package structures:</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Simple</b>
        <ul>
          <li style="text-align: left;"> If the package has esps, esms or bsa's
            at the top level, or if it has any of the regular Morrowind\Data
            Files subdirectories (e.g. Meshes, Textures) at that level, then it
            will be categorized as a simple package.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <b>Complex</b>
        <ul>
          <li> If a package is not simple, but has subdirectories which appear
            simple (have esps/esms/bsas and/or have standard sub-directories),
            then it will be categorized as complex. </li>
          <li> In this case, each top level subdirectory (that appears simple),
            will be treated as a sub-package, and you'll be able to activate or
            deactivate it as desired before installing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b> Complex/Simple</b>
        <ul>
          <li> If a package is complex, but has only one sub-package, then it
            will appear as a simple package in the interface. (I.e. there will
            be no sub-package options.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Skipped Files</b></span> </p>
    <p><i>Bain will skip over (never install) certain types of files in the
        package.</i></p>
    <p><b>Silent Skip</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> A few files are skipped silently. Files in this group are: Thumbs.db
        files, and the omod conversion directory and its subfiles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b> Directory Skipping</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Bain will skip files from directories that it does not recognize.
        I.e. it will only install files that go directly into the Morrowind\Data
        Files directory or one of its regular subdirectories (Meshes, Textures,
        Sound, etc.). Files from irregular directories will be skipped. If this
        happens, you'll find them listed in the Skipped pane on the right.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b> Extension Skipping</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Bain will skip files with certain extensions - mostly executables
        (exe, dll, dlx) and subarchives (7z,zip, etc.). Again, these will be
        listed in the debug pane on the right. (But only if they're not already
        skipped because of the directory that they're in.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>Doc File Sweeping</b></span></p>
    <p><i> In order to prevent clutter and centralize doc file storage, Bain
        will sweep files that appear to be doc files into Morrowind\Data
        Files\Docs. Also, files named simply readme.txt (or readme.doc, etc.)
        will be renamed according to the package name before being swept into
        the Docs directory.</i></p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>Ordering</b></span></p>
    <p><i> Bain assigns an install order to all packages. When packages are
        installed and/or uninstalled, the order is considered in determining
        which files will actually be installed/uninstalled.</i> </p>
    <p><b>General</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Install order is shown the table in the "Order" column. </li>
      <li> All packages are moved to just before the ==Last== marker when Bain
        first encounteres them.</li>
      <li>Order can be changed by right clicking on a package (or group of
        selected packages) and selecting "Move To" or by drag and drop. Just
        enter the position to which the packages should be moved. If you're
        moving many packages at once, they'll keep their relative order, with
        the "oldest" moving to the specified position, and the others following
        after it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Last</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Last is a special marker entry that Bain automatically adds to the
        archive list. It corresponds to the position at which any newly
        encountered packages are inserted. if you want specific packages (e.g.
        your personal projects) to always have high order, then move them to
        after the ==Last== marker.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Install Order</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> When you install a package, then the order of higher packages will be
        respected. I.e. if the package being installed conflicts with a higher
        order package that's already active, then it won't overwrite the files
        from the higher package. Rather, only the files that don't conflict with
        higher packages will be installed. (However, if you want to overwrite
        later packages, then you can use the "Install Last" command, which will
        move the selected packages to the end of the list and then install
        them.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> Uninstall Order</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Uninstalling a package will also respect order. Specifically, files
        that are owned by higher order packages will be left in place. More than
        that, files that aren't owned by the package being uninstalled will also
        be left in place. (Hence manually edited mods and files will be left in
        place.)</li>
      <li>Also, if a lower order package installed an identical version of a
        given file, then that file will not be removed. (I.e. ownership will
        cede to the lower order file.) By the way, you can "uninstall" packages
        that aren't active. This is useful for cleaning out the files from
        packages that you have previously installed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Auto-Annealing</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li> When you uninstall packages, Bain will also attempt to "anneal" the
        file system by restoring any files from active packages that were
        previously blocked by the packages being uninstalled. If you prefer that
        Bain not auto-anneal files, then you can deactivate "Auto-Anneal" from
        the "Settings" menu.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Mod Name Aliasing</b></span></p>
    <p><i> If you make a practice of renaming your installed espm files (as I
        do), then Bain will not be able to match the mod in the package to the
        installed file. So to adjust for that, you can define a mod aliasing
        database.</i></p>
    <p><b>Setup</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> After installing Mash, look for Data
        Files\Mash\Official_Local_default.csv, and copy it to
        "Official_Local.csv" in the same directory.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Open "Official_Local.csv" in your favorite spreadsheet program. Note
        that the file format is csv (comma separated values). When making
        changes be sure to save it in the same CSV format (with comma
        separators)! You'll see that the file has two columns. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li> On the left is "Official" which is the "official" name of the mod,
        i.e. the name of the mod that you'll find in the archive package that
        you downloaded.</li>
      <li> On the right is "Local", which is the "local" name of the mod, i.e.
        the name you prefer for the mod.</li>
      <li> The way this works is simple -- when mash encounters a mod with a
        specified official name, it will map it to the local name. All install,
        uninstall, etc. commands will then act as if the file in the mod
        actually had the local name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b> So to define entries, the easiest thing to do is:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Open Mash and go to the Installers tab. Find a mod for which you have
        changed the name. </li>
      <li> Go to the Missing tab, select and copy the name of the missing mod,
        then paste that into the Official column.</li>
      <li> Go to the Mods Tab, select the mod and copy it's name from the detail
        view on the right and paste that into the Local column next to the
        official name.</li>
      <li> Save changes to the csv file. (Be sure to save in CSV format!)</li>
      <li> Return to Mash Installers tab. Mash should immediately recognize the
        updated file and adjust for its changes. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note: Of course, you don't have to
        change mods one at a time. You can do a bunch at once and then save the
        file, then return to Mash/Bain.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Package Commands</b></span></p>
    <p><i>The following commands are available from the </i><i><i>packages </i>context
        menu.</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Open</b>: Open package(s) in the file system.</li>
      <li> <b>Duplicate</b>: Duplicate package.</li>
      <li> <b>Delete</b>: Delete the package(s).</li>
      <li><b>Repack: </b><i>This is a new function since Wrye Mash v99
          (Polemos). When you right click an installer package you may select
          "Repack" to repack an installer package. After selecting the repack
          option the package explorer will open up, and in there you may select
          the mod's root (the base directory of the mod) by right clicking on
          the folder you believe it must be the root of the mod and selecting
          it. Afterwards by clicking the "OK" button the explorer will close and
          the repack process will begin. When it finishes a new package prefixed
          by "repack" and followed by the source package name will appear at the
          bottom of the Installers list.</i></li>
      <li><i></i><img src="images/repack.jpg" alt="" title="Repack"></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Refresh</b>: Refreshes all info for selected packages. Useful for
        updating info when package has been modified outside of Mash.</li>
      <li> <b>Move To...</b>: Moves selected packages(s) to specified position.
        If multiple packages are active, they'll retain their relative order,
        but move as a block to the selected position.<i><b> </b></i></li>
      <li><i><b>Has Extra Directories:</b> Ordinarily, Bain will only recognize
          a limited set of subdirectories of the Data directory -- and files
          that come from other directories will be skipped over. However if a
          package has special directories (usually restricted to OBSE scripts),
          checking this option will cause Bain to recognize these special
          directories as valid subdirectories (and thus allow them to be
          installed).</i></li>
      <li><b>Anneal</b>: Will "anneal" the selected file(s). This will install
        any missing files and correct any install order errors (aka
        "underrides").</li>
      <li> <b>Install</b>: Will do an "in-order" install. I.e. it will fully
        install the package except for files that are masked by higher order
        packages.</li>
      <li> <b>Install Missing</b>: The same as Install, except that it only
        installs missing files -- i.e. it will not override any currently
        existing files.</li>
      <li> <b>Install Last</b>: Moves the package to to the end of the order
        list and installs it.</li>
      <li> <b>Uninstall</b>: Uninstalls the package. If Auto-Anneal is active,
        then files from lower order packages will automatically be restored as
        necessary.</li>
      <li> <b>Unpack to Project</b>: (Archives only.) Unpack the archive to a
        project.</li>
      <li> <b>Sync from Data:</b> (Projects only.) Synchronize the project with
        files from the Morrowind\Data Files directory. This is essentially the
        reverse of "Install" for projects since it copies from the
        Morrowind\Data Files directory to the project rather than the other way
        around.</li>

    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Package Menu Commands</b></span></p>
    <p><i> The following commands are available by clicking the various menu
        options in the Installers tab:</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Sort by Active:</b> Active installers will be sorted to the top.</li>
      <li> <b>Projects First:</b> If this is checked, then project packages
        will be sorted to the top of the table.</li>
      <li>Also sorting by order, name, size and more.</li>
      <li><b>Open</b>: Opens the Installers directory in Windows Explorer. </li>
      <li> <b>Refresh Data</b>: Rescans the Data directory and all project
        directories. Since this operation takes a little while, this scan is
        ordinarily done only once per Mash session. So, if you have manually
        edited the directories after that one-time scan, you should run this
        command to update Bain to the changes.</li>
      <li> <b>Full Refresh</b>: This does a full refresh of all data files.
        Notably this will recalculate CRCs for all files (ordinarily CRCs are
        only calculated for files that seem to have changed). Running this
        command will likely take 5-15 minutes.</li>
      <li><b>Anneal All:</b> This will install any missing files (for active
        installers) and correct all install order and reconfiguration errors.</li>
      <li><b> Avoid at Startup:</b> Toggles Mash to avoid the Installers tab on
        startup, thus avoiding unnecessary data scanning. Unless you're spending
        a lot of time in the Installers tab, you'll should Enable this.</li>
      <li> <b>Enabled: </b>This enables/disables Bain itself. Preferred
        setting: Enabled (checked).</li>
      <li><b> Clean Data Directory</b>: If this is checked, then any empty
        subfolders of the Morrowind\Data Files directory will be deleted.</li>
      <li> <b>Show Inactive Conflicts:</b> If checked, then the conflicts
        report will show conflicts with inactive as well as active mods. Usually
        only active conflicts are of interest, however sometimes its useful to
        review all conflicting packages.</li>
      <li> <b>Show Lower Conflicts</b>: If checked, then the conflicts report
        with show conflicts with lower order packages. If you're only interested
        in higher order conflicts, the uncheck this to remove some clutter from
        the report.</li>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>Exclusion Groups</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oftentimes users will have different versions of the same mod, or
        different mods which do the same sort of thing in an incompatible way.
        Exclusion groups can be used to help flag these mods so that you don't
        accidentally load more than one at once. When an exclusion group is
        violated, all violating mods will be highlighted in orange.</li>
      <li> Defining an exclusion group is easy -- just change the name of the
        mod to include a comma. The part of the name before the comma is the
        exclusion group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Mod Details mini Tab</b></span></p>

    <p><i> The masters list show the esm files that the current mod depends on,
        and the load order (modIndex) of that master. While there's rarely a
        need to edit the masters of a mod, if the need does arise, you can use
        the masters list to do so. It is recommended that you be familiar with
        editing masters of save games before you attempt to edit masters of
        mods. Click the double hevron button to open the masters lists menu or
        by left clicking on one of the master lists columns.</i></p>
    You can access this menu from the masters mini tab. You have to either click
    the double hevrons icon (in between save and cancel buttons) or left click
    one of the columns of the master list.
    <p><b>Copy List:</b> Right click on the column header of the master list and
      select this command to copy the list of masters to the clipboard. This is
      useful for forum postings where you want help debugging your load list, or
      just want to show off how many mods you have loaded! Note that this list
      is more useful than the list in the morrowind.ini file, since it lists the
      mods in load order. It will also include the version number of the master
      if the description field of the master includes a line like "Version
      ####". Note that this is the same version labeling scheme that the
      Snapshot command (mot the mod order snapshot) uses.</p>
    <p><b>Sync to Load ESMs:</b> This option will sync the master list to
      masters files in your current load list.</p>

                defined load lists.</li>
              <li> [Load List] Selecting a load list causes all of its files to
                be selected. This action is not exclusive, but additive -- i.e.,
                the files will be selected in addition to the currently selected

        you may save/restore your active mod order. You may also open a saved
        mod order, import a saved mod order or export it to a custom location.
        The "Take fast snapshot" and "Restore fast snapshot" are best used when
        you want to make tests in your load order and you don't want many pop
        ups. Do note that "Snapshots" in contrast with "Load Lists" take a

        a Mashed Lists patch automatically now by selecting "Create Mashed
        Patch" option from the menu (Actions). It will automatically delete any
        previous Mashed Patch and replace it with a new one. Afterwards it will
        automatically import and merge your mod lists and enable the patch in
        your mod order.</li>

      <i> Leveled lists determine what creatures you will encounter and what

        additions/changes made be previous mods. This function combines changes
        made to the same leveled lists from different mods and saves the
        combined list to the current mod.</i></p>
    <p><b>Usage</b></p>
    <p><i>This function is only available for mods whose author is "Wrye Mash".
        This is a safety feature to prevent overwriting the load lists of a
        normal mod. If you don't have such a mod available, then start by
        copying "Mashed Lists.esp" from Mopy\Extras to the Data Files folder.</i></p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> Note that you may want to have
        different versions of the Mashed List esp for different load sets. If
        this is the case, just duplicate one Mashed List esp and rename it as
        desired.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a copy of Merged_Leveled_Lists.esp (produced by TesTool),
        then remove it from your load list. You won't need it anymore. Note too
        that you won't need to use the Leveled List Resequencer tool. The Import
        Merged List lists are already resequenced. </li>

    <p><b> Tech Notes</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Mash's Merge List function is a bit more efficient that TesTools --
        if there's no need to merge lists, then it won't. </li>
      <li>In merging lists, Mash ignores lists from any of the three Bethesda
        Masters, under the assumption that anything in them will also be in any
        plugin that tries to modify them. </li>
      <li>In merging lists, Mash ignores any mod whose author is "Wrye Mash". </li>
      <li>When merging two lists:
        <ul>
          <li>Chance None is set to Chance None of last mod to change list. </li>
          <li>Calculate for Each Item is true if it's true for either list. </li>

          <li>All entries from the first list, plus any new items in the second
            list will be included in the merged list. </li>

            comes from the last mod to modify that list.</li>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Import Replacer</b></span></p>
    <p><b>Overview</b> </p>
    <p><i>Ref replacers allow you to systematically replace one set of
        references with another. For example you can "NOMify" a mod that adds
        towns by systematically replacing empty bottles with equivalent NOM
        bottles; and static ovens, grills, cauldrons and kegs with equivalent
        NOM activators.</i> </p>
    <p><b>Setup</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Select <b>Import</b>: Edit Replacers, and use the resulting dialog
        to add a replacer file. Be sure that the file that you have selected is
        a replacer file!</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Usage</b></p>
    <p>Select <b>Import</b>: [Replacer Name]. You'll receive a report on all
      replacements made and records imported.</p>
    <p><b> Tech Notes</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> The mod replacer file defines which object ids's are to be replaced
        and with what object ids, and (optionally) which source mod to copy
        records from. </li>
      <li>If multiple replacements are defined, then each of the replacements
        objects will be used in turn. E.g. for NOM, the first morrowind kegstand
        will be replaced with a beer barrel, the second will be replaced with a
        wine barrel, etc. </li>
      <li>If you define a source mod (srcmod), then the replacer will grab a
        copy of each object id used from the srcMod and copy it to the target
        mod. E.g., if the user only replaces bottles, then only bottle object
        definitions will be imported into the target mod. If you don't define a
        srcmod, then nothing will be imported.<br>
        In the mod, only the id of the placed object will be changed. Thus, the
        replacement should work at the coordinate/orientation used by the
        original, and the original should not have extra info that is
        incompatible with the replacements type! I.e., if the original is a
        soulgem and includes info on the type of soul included, then the
        replacement should not be anything but another soulgem. This means that
        you have to to know what you're doing when you're defining a
        replacement. (Probably the main limitation is not replacing soulgems or
        things that have uses.) </li>
      <li>Be aware that ref replacement doesn't do any spell checking... So be
        sure that both the original and replacement items are spelled correctly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Renumber Refs</b></span></p>
    <p><i> This is an advanced feature intended to reduce the likelihood of
        local refs conflicts between mods. It works by renumbering the local
        refs placed by the esp, so that instead of starting objectIndex numbers
        at 1, it starts them at some random number between 1,000 and 10,000 (or
        a user selected number between 1 and 100,000.)</i></p>
    <p> <b>Notes</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>This feature is experimental! Seems okay so far, but it does something
        a little unexpected and perhaps Morrowind engine won't like that. </li>
      <li>The main problem with doing this is that every time TESCS is used to
        edit the esp, it will renumber the object indexes starting from 1. So,
        this feature is best used by end users rather than by modders. (Since
        end users don't re-edit the esps.) </li>
      <li>This command remembers the starting object index numbers for each mod.
        If used a second time on the same mod, it will default to the same
        starting index number it used last time. So, if you have to edit the esp
        with TESCS, just run the command again. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Usage</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>[Optional] Duplicate the original mod and make changes to the
        duplicate rather than the original. If you're going to modify an esp
        that is already in use by save games, you'll need to do this (and create
        and use an updater) in order to prevent doubling.</li>
      <li> After selecting the command, you can either accept the suggested
        first value (randomly chosen between 1,000 and 10,000), or manually
        enter a value between 1 and 100,000.</li>

    <p><i> This sorts the file records so that they can be more easily found in
        the TESCS Details view.</i></p>
    <p><b> Ordering Details</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> TES files are only semi-ordered. Some records must be in a certain
        order, e.g. DIALs and their associated INFO's form a block. Other
        records seem to have a record preferred by TESCS/Morrowind, while other
        types of records are loosely intermixed (e.g., most object type
        records). </li>
      <li>The sort record commands follows both the required and preferred
        record order rules, but also orders records more strictly by record type
        and by record id (when available, and when not in conflict with other
        rules). This stricter ordering makes records easier to find. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Inherited Order</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Records that are modifications of pre-existing records (i.e., records
        inherited from master esms and even from esps selected in the load list)
        will be reordered when TESCS saves the esp file so that the inherited
        records are moved to the top of their TESCS save group (e.g., the "most
        objects" group), in the order that TESCS originally saw them in -- which
        is fairly disordered. </li>
      <li>However, it seems to be safe to use the Sort Records command on the
        Bethesda esms themselves. (But don't be surprised if Mash hangs for a
        minute or so while sorting Morrowind.esm!) Once this is done, when
        saving your esp, the modified records will still be moved up, but at
        least they'll be ordered by record type and id. </li>

    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Masters List</b></span></p>
    <p> The masters list show the esm and esp files that the current save game
      depends on, and the load order (modIndex) of that master. Editing the
      masters list of a save game is probably the most common use of Mash, since
      it is the action that is necessary to prevent doubling. For more
      information, see <a href="#ModUpdating">Mod Updating</a> below. </p>
    <p>You can access this menu from the masters mini tab. You have to either
      click the double hevrons icon (in between save and cancel buttons) or left
      click one of the columns of the master list.</p>
    <p><b>Copy List:</b> Right click on the column header of the master list and
      select this command to copy the list of masters to the clipboard. This is
      useful for forum postings where you want help debugging your load list, or
      just want to show off how many mods you have loaded! Note that this list
      is more useful than the list in the morrowind.ini file, since it lists the
      mods in load order. It will also include the version number of the master
      if the description field of the master includes a line like "Version
      ####". Note that this is the same version labeling scheme that the
      Snapshot command (mot the mod order snapshot) uses.</p>
    <p><b>Sync to Load List:</b> This option will apply your current mod order
      to your saved game.</p>
    <p><b>Update</b>: Updates masters list and prepares it for further manual
      editing. Automatically fixes: names, sizes and load order.</p>
    <p><b>Restore Mod Order from Save:</b> This will restore the mod order saved
      inside your saved game, essentially it is the opposite of "Sync to Load
      List".</p>

    <p><i> You can now define several different savegame profiles and easily
        switch between them. Each profile consists of a set of savegames and a
        Morrowind.ini file. Use the Profile menu to edit and switch between
        profiles.</i></p>
    <p><b> If you wish to move savegame files between profiles:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Load the profile currently containing the savegames to be moved. </li>
      <li>Select the files, then right click on the selected files and select
        File: Move To... Use the directory dialog to specify to select a

    <ul>
      <li><b>Move To:</b> moves the selected save files to the specified
        directory. Usually this will be one of the subdirectories of
        Saves\Mash\Hidden, since these subdirectories correspond to your
        Profiles (see below). </li>
      <li><b>Remove</b>: There are several commands for removing different types
        of references and other data from save files. </li>
      <li><b>Debris Cells:</b> This removes all references in cells that have
        been visited, but are not supported by the current set of masters.
        Typically this is used to cleanup exterior cells that were added by mods
        that have since been removed. </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note
        that if you have intentionally placed objects into such cells (e.g., a

    <ul>
      <li><b>Spawned Creatures:</b> This removes all lvcr (leveled creature)
        references from the file.In other words, it resets all spawn points. </li>

        are associated with the spawn point. So resetting the spawn point only
        removes that single npc/creature. To fully clear npc/creature groups use
        a object list remover (see below). For a savegame, this has the effect
        of resetting all spawn points.</span></div>

          <li>Next, select "Edit Removers..." and select one or more of the
            files in Mopy\Data. This will add that(those) file(s) to the list of

      <hr></h2>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Doubling Theory</b></span></p>
    <p><b>Full Explanation</b></p>
    <p><b>Background: Reference Ids </b> </p>
    <p>So, you start Morrowind, load your last saved game, and find yourself in
      Balmora. There on the bridge is the same MCA character. There at your feet
      is the potion that you just dropped. Over there is the door that you
      opened. And it occurs to you... How does Morrowind keep track of all this
      stuff? How does it know this potion is supposed to be here? How does it
      know that door needs to be open?</p>
    <p> The answer is reference ids -- every object that you see in the game
      world has an unique numerical id attached to it, defining it. When you
      load a set of mods (as you do when Morrowind starts up), Morrowind first
      recreates the world in a "virgin" (i.e. unchanged state). Then, when you
      load a savegame, it reapplies all the changes that you made -- killing
      bandits, filling quests, opening doors, moving NPCs, etc. It makes those
      changes by matching the reference ids stored in the savegame against the
      reference ids as calculated for the virgin gameworld (i.e. for the the set
      of loaded mods).</p>
    <p> Unfortunately this matching/updating process can go wrong sometimes.
      Doubling is the most obvious such problem. But other problems can happen,
      e.g., changes meant for a bar door might be applied to an NPC. These
      mismatches might be invisible, might cause weird behavior, or might cause
      CTDs. As people have found in the past, if enough of them pile up (e.g.,
      after repeatedly changing the mod list), you will get corrupted unplayable
      games.</p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);"> Note that all of these problems
        are caused by mismatches between reference ids! E.g. from your loaded
        mod list, Morrowind determines that the referenceid number for that door
        should be 345672-05, but your savegame thinks that the reference id for
        the door should be 345672-07, or maybe 345674-05. So the secret to
        avoiding doubling, etc. is simply preventing such mismatches. Well,
        easier said then done, unfortunately!</span></p>
    <p>So, a little more background... Each reference id is actually two
      numbers: the ObjectIndex and the ModIndex. For each mod, the objectindex
      is unique, i.e., there's only one "1292" objectindex in each mod. The
      modindex, on the other hand is simply the order of the source mod in the
      load list. Morrowind.esm loads first, so it has modindex == 1. Tribunal
      and Bloodmoon if loaded, are usually numbers 2 and 3 respectively. Okay,
      but how about objects that don't really belong to a particular mod? E.g.
      an arrow that you bought and dropped on the ground? Simple enough, these
      objects belong to the savegame itself, and are given the special modindex
      of 0.</p>
    <p> That's the basic story. There are a lot of exceptions and complications
      (e.g., spawnpoints), but that's the basics, so let's go on...<br>
      Reasons for Reference Mismatching.</p>
    <p> If you change the mod load order -- either by adding new mods that want
      to load before your current mod, or by resaving a mod (which changes its
      modification date, and thus load order), then the ModIndex numbers will be
      mismatched.</p>
    <p>Also, if a mod has had new references added, then many of its
      objectIndexes of existing references will be changed. This is because
      TESCS completely renumbers all references when the mod is saved. </p>
    <p>There are quite a few technicalities and qualifications here, but that's
      the gist of it.</p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Morrowind Repair Work</b></span></p>
    <p>If the load order changes, Morrowind tries to correct ModIndex numbers.
      If only the load order has changed (i.e., exactly the same files with the
      same names are present), then it seems to do a pretty good job of
      adapting.</p>
    <p>But if new mods are added or if old mods are given new names, it gets
      confused and its repair often fails. </p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note that the effect of this
        failure may not be immediately apparent, and the effects may oscillate
        under certain conditions -- e.g., doors may disappear and reappear with
        each new load change.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Doubling Prevention/Repair</b></span></p>
    <p>So to prevent/fix doubling, you need to do several things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Prevent modification date related mod disordering. (See <a href="#LoadOrderMaintenance">Load
          Order Maintenance</a>.) </li>
      <li>Adjust ModIndex numbers to account for new load ordering. (I.e.
        complete the job that Morrowind does partially.) (See <a href="#MasterListUpdating">Master
          List Updating</a>.) </li>
      <li>Repair existing damaged games files by removing existing corrupted
        records. (See <a href="#MasterListUpdating">Master List Updating</a>.)
      </li>
      <li>Adjust for changes to objectIndex numbering from mod modification.

      <li> In order to prevent doubling and to get correct behavior out of mods,
        it is important that they load in the correct order. Since mod load
        order is determined by their modified time, it is important to be able
        to set and keep fixed the modified time.</li>
      <li> To set the load order of a mod, just edit the Modified field of the
        mod in the details view.</li>
      <li> To keep the modified time fixed, Turn on the "Lock Times" feature in
        the menu of the Mods Tab. When this is done, Mash will memorize the
        modified times for all files that it sees. Then, whenever Mash launches,
        or comes to the foreground, it will check to see if any Modified times
        have changed, and if so, reset them to the earlier memorized values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);"> Note: If you want to use a
        non-Mash load ordering utility, you'll first need to turn off "Lock
        Times". When you're finished with the external ordering utility, turn
        Lock Times back on. It will reset to use the times set by the other
        utility.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> <a name="ModUpdating">Mod
            Updating</a></b></span></p>
    <p> As described above, adding references to (or removing references from)
      an existing mod is likely to cause doubling. Part of the cause of this is
      reordering of the mod (which is fixed by Lock Times ), but the other cause
      is ObjectIndex renumbering. Fixing this second problem requires that the
      objectIndex numbers be remapped in the save file (e.g., remap object
      number 123 to number 234). This can be done in Mash, but requires several
      stages.</p>
    <p> <b>Procedure</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> First, there must be separate mod files for the original mod and for
        the updated mod, and these mod files must have different names (e.g.,
        "AoScrye 1.1.esp" and "AoScrye 1.15.esp"). </li>
      <li>For modders, it's okay to continue to modify the original mod, so long
        as you do not add or remove refs, and so long as you do not change the
        id of any placed refs! </li>
      <li>If you need to add or remove refs, then these changes need to be made
        on a new version of the mod. (Just use the File: Duplicate command and
        rename the new copy as desired.) </li>
      <li>Second, you need to generate an "Updater" for each old/new version
        pair. </li>
      <li>Select the new version of the mod in the Mods tab and then select
        "Updaters..." from the context menu. This will popup a new dialog which
        will list the updaters available for that mod. </li>
      <li>Click on "Add" and select the old version of the mod. This will create
        the updater, which will now be shown in the list. If some of your save
        games depend on even older versions (e.g., "AoScrye 1.0.esp"), then you
        can add additional updaters for those. </li>
      <li>Third, update the masters list of the save game that you want to
        update. </li>
      <li>In the saves tab, select the save game you want to update, and, in its
        master list, change the name of the old esp version to the new esp
        version. I.e., click on the old name and then either edit the master
        name in place, or use the context menu to select the new master. If
        you've done this correctly, then the updated master will be hilighted in
        dark green. (Masters that have been changed, but don't have an updater
        applied are highlighted in pale green.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b> Merged Plugins</b></span></p>
    <p> If you have a save game that is dependent on one or more plugins which
      are merged into combined plugin, then you can define an Updater from the
      original plugin(s) to the merged plugin. E.g., if your save game depends
      on "Alpha.esp" and "Beta.esp" and these are then merged to form
      "Gamma.esp", then you can define updaters as above and then, in the save
      game master list, rename both "Alpha.esp" and "Beta.esp" to "Gamma.esp".</p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);"> Note that should work well, so
        long as the merged files do not place the same type of object into the
        same cell. However, even in this case, running Repair All should fix any
        problems.</span></p>

    <p><b> Master/Save/Mod Health</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> In the master list, checkbox colors indicate the "health" of that
        master. Blue is best, red is worst. Green, yellow and orange represent
        intermediate levels of health. </li>
      <li>In the saves and mods list, the checkbox color is the same as the
        least healthy of its masters. I.e. if, for a save, one master is orange
        and the rest are green, then the save's checkbox will be orange. The
        exception to this is purple, which is a sort of "superblue". </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>More specifically, and from worst to best, the meanings of master
        colors are:</b> </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="images/checkbox_red_on.png" alt="">Red: The master is missing.
      Either the mod file has been removed, or its name has been changed.</p>
    <p><img src="images/checkbox_orange_on.png" alt="">Orange: The master file
      is out of load order compared to the rest of the masters in the master
      list. <br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/checkbox_yellow_on.png" alt="">Yellow: The master file's
      size has changed since the game was last saved. This likely indicates a
      change to the mod file -- which may result in objectIndex caused
      mismatching. </p>
    <p><img src="images/checkbox_green_on.png" alt="">Green: The master file is
      in order compared to the other files in the master list, but is out of
      order compared to the files in the current load list. </p>
    <p><img src="images/checkbox_blue_on.png" alt="">Blue: The master file is
      synced, has the right size and is in the right order. </p>
    <p><img src="images/checkbox_purple_on.png" alt="">Purple: This will only
      appears for saves. It indicates that not only are all of the masters
      synced, but also that no extra masters are loaded. If a save is blue (not
      purple), then the load list contains an extra esp that the save is not yet
      dependent on. If you play the save, then the save will become dependent on
      that new master. </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>For save games, you want every master to be blue - i.e. you want the save
      itself to be blue. </p>
    <p>Mod files have much less problems than save files -- so it's sufficient
      if all masters are orange or better. I.e., as long as the master is
      present, it should be okay. For this reason, for mod files, "green" is
      considered to be perfect health. </p>
    <p><b>When to Update Masters </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the save game checkbox color is blue, then it's fine -- there's no
        need to edit it. </li>
      <li>If the save game checkbox color is green, then its master list is
        fine, but it not compatible with the current load list. You can use the
        "Load Masters" to sync load list with the master list. Note that the
        load list does not have to be exactly the same as the master list. It
        can have additional load files, so long as those files will load after
        the files in the save games master list. Otherwise, you should edit the
        load list. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Updating the Load List </b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you like, you can create a duplicate or snapshot of the file before
        you edit it. But remember that Mash also will automatically create a
        backup that you can revert to. So, creating a duplicate is simply an
        extra measure of safety. </li>
      <li>Bring up the context menu for the masters list column header,
        select&nbsp; "Edit", and then click "Yes" in the dialog that appears.
        Doing this will result in some initial cleaning of the list: </li>
      <li>Master files will be placed in the correct order. </li>
      <li>Missing files will be renamed if Mash thinks it knows what the new
        name is. Otherwise the missing master will be unchecked. </li>
      <li>The correct file size will be applied. </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note
        that files that have had their name or size changed will now be
        hilighted in green.</span></p>
    <p><b>If all masters are checked and are either green or blue, then you're
        probably done and can save your changes. Otherwise, continue...</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can rename masters by editing their label directly or by using the
        "Change to..." command from the master item popup menu. (Right click on
        the master name.) This will bring up a dialog allowing you to select an
        esm or esp. </li>
      <li>You can change esm references to esp references and vice versa. (E.g.,
        suppose you depending on an esp that has since been converted to an
        esm.) </li>
      <li>You can change different existing masters to point to the same new
        master. </li>
      <li>You might do this if you merged several head mods. (Note that merging
        may cause objectIndex doubling -- so hopefully the merge has been done
        in such a way as to prevent that.) When the file is saved, these
        different master references will be merged into a single reference. </li>
      <li>If the rename has an Updater associated with it (i.e., from "AoScrye
        1.1.esp" to "AoScrye 1.15.esp"), then the new name will highlighted in
        dark green. Otherwise, the rename will be highlighted in pale green.

        auto-renames (look for green highlighted items) to see if they look
        right. </li>
      <li>Then use "Sync to Load List, do a final inspection and save the file.

    <ul>
      <li>When you run Repair All, you'll either get a report that no repairs
        were necessary, or you'll get a report of repairs that were made.
        Repairs will take the form of either rematches or deletions. </li>
      <li>Rematches: The Repair All function compares the object id for each
        reference with the object id expected from the save files master list
        for the references combined modIndex and objectIndex. If they those id's
        don't match, then Repair All tries to find a different value of modIndex
        for with the id's do match. If it finds such a match and if that match
        is not already used by another reference, then it switches the reference
        to use the new modIndex. This is a rematch. </li>
      <li>If Mash can't find a non ambiguous match, then it will report "NO
        MASTER" and delete the reference. </li>
      <li>If Mash finds a match, but it's already in use, then it will report
        "DOUBLE" and delete the reference. </li>
      <li>Also if Mash finds a reference that is marked as "Deleted" but has a
        modIndex of 0 (meaning that it's owned by the save file, not any of its
        masters), then Mash will delete the reference. Note that a save game
        needs to remember when a master file reference is deleted, but should
        not remember when a save-game owned reference is deleted -- since
        there's no need to do so. These bad deletes seem to be responsible for
        doors, NPCs, etc. that disappear and reappear with every change in the
        load list. </li>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><b>Repair All Command</b></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li> In addition to repairing refs, as described above, Repair All

      <li> Remove Orphan Contents</li>
      <li>Content records (CREC, CNTC and NPCCC) records that have become
        disassociated with a place reference are removed. </li>
      <li>Remove Debris Records: Sometimes gameplay leaves a modified copy of a
        database object even after the mod that "owns" that database object is
        no longer in the load list. This is common for globals (GLOBs), but also
        occurs for a variety of other records (NPC_s, LEVCs, etc.). </li>
      <li>The list of object ids in the save game is compared against the object
        ids provided by the game's master files, and records that are unmatched
        are deleted.</li>
      <li>Exceptions: Some items are intentionally created in game (new spells,
        enchanted items). Also, the MonthsToRespawn global is created during
        gameplay. These records are excepted from the Debris removal process.</li>
      <li> Remove Overriding Lists: Mods that modify leveled lists through the
        addToLev and removeFromLev script commands will cause copies of those
        (modified) leveled lists to be added to the savegame itself. This
        approach conflicts with the use of leveled list mergers since the
        savegame copy of the leveled list will override even the merged leveled
        list esp. Accordingly, the scripted approach is now considered obsolete.
        Mods should no longer use the leveled list script commands. However,
        this still leaves the problem of cleaning savegames that are
        contaminated by older leveled list modifications. Repair All will now
        (as of version 0.70) do this. </li>
      <li>Repair All will remove any leveled list in the savegame if more than
        one master mod has a copy of the list. (Thus unique lists belonging to a
        single mod may still use script commands.) </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note however, that if an older
        script modifying mod is still present in your load list, it will most
        likely continue to readd the leveled list back into the savegame. The
        solution to this is to update/patch the offending mod to no longer use
        the leveled list script commands.</span></p>

    <p><b><i>Polemos: Not yet available in stand alone.</i></b></p>
    <p>Mish is a command line interface to the features of mash. At the moment,
      there are a couple of features that you can access from it that you can't
      access from the GUI. Also, with a bit of python coding you can do some
      pretty nice useful mangling of tes3 files. </p>
    <p><b> Mish Commands</b></p>
    <p><b>Using Mish</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chdir to the mopy directory and then (if you have python environment
        fully defined), type mish commandName [arguments]. </li>
      <li>If you don't have the python environment fully defined, then type:
        python mish.py commandName [arguments] </li>
      <li>I'm assuming that you at least have the python.exe in your command
        path. If you're confused, but desirous of learning more, go to
        python.org and look for info on setting up your python environment. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>refInfo</b></p>
    <p>This command will give you info on the refs in a file. Typically, I use
      this for finding which references are changed from (faster). </p>
    <p><b>Usage:</b> refInfo "Yadda yadda.esp" </p>
    <p>There's a line in the refInfo function that goes like "if object[0] ==
      0". Set this way it will tell you about all new references in the file.
      But if you change it to "!= 0" it will tell you about all changed
      references in the file. Which is useful if you want to know what you've
      accidentally bumped into while changing refs in a given cell.</p>
    <p> <b>cleanRefs</b></p>
    <p><b>Usage</b>: cleanRefs "Yadda.ess" "Data\Beth All.etxt" </p>
    <p>This removes references from Yadda.ess that match the objects listed in
      "Data\Beth All.etxt". Or you can use one of the other list files or make
      your own. </p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">DO NOT USE THIS ON AN ESP FILE</span>
      Unless, of course, you want to blow away a bunch of the references in that
      esp. Hmmm... Actually, that might be useful for cleaning gunk out of your
      file... But you had better know what you're doing -- this file makes no
      distinction between refs that you've modified from an esm and refs that
      you've placed yourself.</p>
    <p> <b>genSchedule</b> </p>
    <p><b>Usage</b>: genSchedule "My Seyda Neen Schedule.etxt" "My Seyda
      Neen.esp"</p>
    <p>Munches a schedule text file and from it generates a set of LCV style
      scheduling scripts. These scripts will either be written to the specified
      esp file or to a text file named after the source file (e.g., "My Seyda
      Neen Schedule.mws") if you leave off the second argument (name of the
      esp). </p>
    <p>While this writes the scheduling scripts to the file, it does not compile
      them. You'll need to open the esp file in TESCS and either compile each
      new/updated script in turn, or use the compile all button. (But if you do
      that, you'll probably need to save, then go to the details view and delete
      several scripts that were uncompiled or incorrectly compiled in the
      original morrowind.esm, then open and resave. (Though I think that some of
      these four are fixed in the other Bethesda esms.)</p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note that the "LCV Schedules.etxt"
        does not contain any of the idle defs. That's because all of these are
        defined in (and loaded frm) mush.py. You can still define and use your
        own idle (or any other defs), but I would advise that you use the ones
        in mush.py if possible since they're fairly standard.)</span></p>
    <p><b> etxtToHtml</b></p>
    <p>This command generates html documents from an etxt document. I use this
      to generate all my html docs -- e.g. this one. </p>
    <p><b>Usage</b>: etxtToHtml yadda.etxt </p>
    <p>This will generate yadda.html in the same directory. </p>

    <p><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"></span></p>
    <p>Mash now supports localization for most(?) western languages (translation
      of program strings to local language). It supports non-roman character
      sets (Cyrillic, Arabic, Asian languages, etc.) but this needs testing.
      Since you're looking here, I'm assuming that you're trying to add
      translations for your language. Here's how:</p>
    <p><b> Custom Program Strings</b> </p>
    <p>Custom program strings are translated from lookup files that you'll find
      in the Mopy\local. E.g., for English, it would be Mopy\locale\English.pkl.
      (Of course, the program is already in English, so this isn't needed.) </p>
    <p>These pkl files are automatically compiled from the corresponding txt
      files (e.g., Mopy\locale\English.txt) as needed when Mash (or mish) starts
      up. So, to update the program strings for your language all you have to do
      is edit the txt file in a text editor adding translations for strings.
      Naturally, not everyone needs to do this -- once someone does the txt
      files for a language, they can redistribute them to other people --
      including me, so that I can include them in next Mash release.</p>
    <p>If the text file for your language doesn't exist yet, open a DOS shell,
      chdir to the Mopy directory and type python mish.py dumpTranslator. This
      will create a new text language file for you in the locale directory
      (e.g., Mopy\locale\NEWEnglish.txt). If you already have some strings
      translated, this new file should contain all of them. And if mash has
      added new strings to be translated, they will appear. </p>
    <p>So to create the strings, all you have to do is edit the text file to add
      the translations, and save the file with the leading "NEW" stripped off.</p>
    <p><b> Translation Tips</b></p>
    <p><b>Here's part of the a translator file. </b><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-family: Consolas;">masher.py, 4605<br>
        Default profile cannot be removed.<br>
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
        masher.py, 4611<br>
        Delete profile %s and the %d save files it contains?<br>
        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
        DELETE PROFILE %s AND THE %d SAVE FILES IT CONTAINS?</span> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each entry begins with the source file and the line number (in case
        this helps you figure out how to translate the code). </li>
      <li>After that is the original text, then a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dividing
        line, then the translated text. Here, the second entry has been
        translated, while the first has not. (Here the the "translation"
        consists of changing it to upper case. </li>
      <li>It's important that you leave the formatting characters in place and
        in order! Formatting characters are text like %s %d %08X \n. The '%'
        strings are place holders where file names, counts, etc. are entered --
        if they're not present, Mash will throw an exception. The \n
        combinations are newline characters -- I use them in dialogs and other
        places where I want line breaks. </li>
      <li>In translating, I would suggest that you translate the strings that
        you see the most first. E.g., a good one for a quick test is masher.py,
        2126: Mods -- this is the name of the Mods tab. And right under it is
        the name of the Saves tab. </li>
      <li>To test your translations, just save your changes to the text file,
        and restart Mash. Your changes should appear immediately. </li>
      <li>Of course, it's probably a good idea to keep backup copies of your
        translator file in case you mess one up. If you revert to a backup copy,
        just throw the pkl version away to it to update. (Remember it won't
        autocompile unless the text file is newer than the pkl file.) </li>
      <li>Spell checking: If you're using an office suite, you might want turn
        on dictionaries for both English and your language -- Abot mentions that
        Open Office allows you to do this.</li>

      </b></p>
    <p><b>The following are from </b><b><b>Wrye and</b> kept for historical
        reasons, information is not accurate anymore in a lot of places:</b></p>
    <p><b>Python </b> </p>
    <p>I've programmed in something like 20-30 different languages and of those,
      Python is by far the easiest and most powerful. I strongly recommend it
      both for first time programmers and experienced, professional programmers.
    </p>
    <p>As you'll see from the code, it's an untyped, object oriented language.
      (By "untyped" I mean that you don't have to declare the type of variables
      before using them.) </p>
    <p>You'll also notice that it's compact with very little overhead -- it's
      probably about as close a programming language can get to pseudocode --
      i.e., to the way you think the program. </p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note that when you installed
        python, you got a very complete manual. When programming, I just keep
        this manual open.</span></p>
    <p> <b>wxPython </b> </p>
    <p>wxWidgets is a cross-platform GUI widget set. wxPython is a python
      wrapper around that library. Unlike Java, the graphics are native to each
      platform-- hence drawing operations are fast. </p>
    <p>However, while there's a fair amount of documentation for wxPython,
      between wxPython and wxWidgets, there can be something of a documentation
      gap. In several places I had to search for a while, and do some
      experiments before I figured out the right way to do things. In a few
      other places I couldn't get things to work, that from the wxWidgets
      documentation seemed like they should work. So, it's not a completely
      mature platform. </p>
    <p>However, the end result looks damned good and is responsive, (not bad for
      my first real GUI application!) so I'm not regretting the choice. </p>
    <p>For your interface work: The closer you stick to my code the easier
      things will go. </p>
    <p>As mentioned before, the wxPython manual and docs are a separate install
      from the base wxPython install. There are several types of help available
      in it. </p>
    <p>Most useful is the wxPython Demo. This is where I usually start. </p>
    <p>Of secondary use are the wxPython manuals. These are fairly complete, but
      they're primarily designed for the c++ version of wxWidgets. The
      conversion from C++ call to python call is unfortunately not always
      documented or obvious. </p>
    <p>And of course, there's the web. A well chosen google search will
      oftentimes help substantially. </p>
    <p><b>Mechanics: Editors and Navigation</b></p>
    <p> <b>Polemos</b>: <i>You will find that Wrye Mash code is very elegant
        and proffesional. There are thinks to learn for a pythonista here. Note:
        If you want to do some serious coding, you'll probably want to get a
        decent editor like pycharm.</i></p>
    <p><b> Getting Started (by Wrye)</b></p>
    <p><b>Python </b> </p>
    <p>If you're not familiar with it, check out python.org. There are lots of
      links to good tutorials there. Also, the python installation </p>
    <p><b>Mish.py</b> </p>
    <p>Command line programming is definitely easier than GUI! So if you just
      want to understand the data level code, you can restrict yourself to
      mosh.py and mish.py. </p>
    <p>I'd suggest that you make your own copy of mish.py and then play around
      with extracting data and spitting stuff out. Then when you feel confident,
      you can start modifying files.<br>
      GUI Programming. </p>
    <p>Context menu items are the easiest things to add. They're relatively
      simple, and I've specifically designed the code to make it easy to add new
      menu commands. </p>
    <p><b>Menu definition and Creation </b> </p>
    <p>Both menu items and the Morrowind buttons are subclasses of my Link
      class. </p>
    <p>You'll notice that I define these classes last in the file, and don't
      actually them into the interface until the InitLinks() function. </p>
    <p>Examples </p>
    <p>MorrowindLink creates the Morrowind Launch button in the status bar. </p>
    <p>It's very simple, and by following it back you can see how it get's added
      into the bar. </p>
    <p>UnHideLink Is more complicated, but is still pretty comprehensible. </p>
    <p>FileStatsLink Is not very complicated in itself, but that's only because
      it pushes most of the interface work onto a new class FileStatsList. But
      it's an example of a menu command that introduces a little extra </p>
    <p><b>GUI complexity.</b></p>
    <p><b>Code Layout (by Wrye)</b></p>
    <p>The code is self documenting... Yeah, right! Actually, I keep my code
      pretty clean and well laid out so it shouldn't be too bad. But there are
      few hints that I can give you... </p>
    <p>Python supports internal code documentation through the the triple quote
      syntax ("""Function does x.""") This is similar to Java's code documenting
      feature. I've used this a little bit, but not as much as I should have.</p>
    <p> <b>mosh </b> </p>
    <p><b>Settings </b> </p>
    <p>The class and singleton are defined in mosh.py and used by other modules.
    </p>
    <p>For convenience, I use dictionary emulation to allow the singleton to be
      accessed like a dictionary. (E.g., _getitem_ supports the settings[key]
      syntax. </p>
    <p><b>FileInfo and FileInfos </b> </p>
    <p>These are parent classes for ModInfo and ModInfos, and SaveInfo,
      SaveInfos. </p>
    <p>I.e., basically mod and save files and collections of them. </p>
    <p><b>TES3 File Structure </b> </p>
    <p>Basically, I only defined as much as I had to. </p>
    <p>For performance reasons, I don't analyze the data file any more than I
      have to. E.g., for the remapMasters function, I only care about the
      objects in the cells. Thus there's all other records (except for TES3) are
      left in their raw data form, and even for cell objects, I leave most
      subrecords in raw data form. </p>
    <p>Note also the use of the changed flags -- this allows me to skip
      repacking data if the cell record hasn't been changed.</p>
    <p> <b>masher </b> </p>
    <p>images and colours are convenience collections for correspond objects. </p>
    <p>Final interface assembly does not take place until the end, through the
      various init functions. This is done to make the program more easily
      modifiable. (And easy to write in the first place!)</p>
    <p><b> Data and Extras</b><br>
      The Mash distribution includes additional files that assist in its
      operation and/or assist the modder in other ways...</p>
    <p><b> Data: Ref Removers</b><br>
      These are text files that define Ref Removers.</p>
    <p><b> Beth All.etxt </b><br>
      &nbsp; Bethesda non-unique containers and creatures. </p>
    <p><b> Beth Containers.etxt</b><br>
      &nbsp; Bethesda non-unique containers.</p>
    <p><b> Beth Creatures.etxt </b><br>
      &nbsp; Bethesda non-unique creatures.</p>
    <p><b> Beth Doors.etxt </b><br>
      &nbsp; Bethesda non-unique doors.</p>
    <p><b> Wrye All.etxt </b><br>
      &nbsp; Wrye creatures plus Beth containers and MCA 4.1 NPCs.</p>
    <p><b> Wrye Creatures.etxt </b><br>
      &nbsp; Creatures from Bethesda plus Mephisto's Creature Pack and Pirate
      Lords's Creatures.</p>
    <p><b> Data: Ref Replacers</b><br>
      These are text files that define Ref Replacers.</p>
    <p><b> MCA Refs.etxt</b> </p>
    <p>MCA spawn points. Note that these require that that placeholder spawn
      points be pre-added to the mod first. </p>
    <p>So why not just add MCA spawn points directly? Because this way, MCA
      becomes optional -- it's up to the user whether they want to install MCA
      or not. Also, if some other mod provides MCA-like functionality, a
      replacer can be defined to place their NPCs instead of MCA NPCs.</p>
    <p><b> NOM Refs.etxt </b><br>
      &nbsp; Bottles, keg stands, ovens, wells, etc. This replaces certain
      statics and misc items with their NOM equivalents.</p>
    <p> <b>Extras</b><br>
      These are miscellaneous files used to assist Mash functions, etc.</p>
    <p><b> ESTemplate.ini</b> </p>
    <p>A template file for use with Enchanted Editor. </p>
    <p><b> Mashed Lists.esp</b> </p>
    <p>Template file for Mash's leveled list merge and resequence feature. </p>
    <p>Copy this to your data files directory. </p>
    <p><b>NOM MiniRes.esp</b> </p>
    <p>This file is a mini resource esp for NOM (Necesities of Morrowind) that
      is used by the NOM Ref Replacer. </p>
    <p>Although this file should never be selected as a load mod, it needs to be
      copied to your Data Files directory in order for the NOM Ref Replacer to
      work. (The Ref Replacer will, as necessary, copy object definitions out of
      this file and into the mod being modified.) </p>
    <p>XXX ====.esp </p>
    <p>When you have hundreds of esps, it can become difficult to find the esp
      that you're looking for, especially in TESCS. One approach is to
      chronologically reorder the esps by type. E.g., all of my Race mods are
      set to have their modification date in the month of July 2001. </p>
    <p>If you done something like this, then you can use something like these
      spacer esps to help find those mods in your mod listing. </p>
    <p><b>Usage</b>: Copy these esps to your Data Files directory, set their
      dates as desired and then set the dates of your various mods so that they
      group as desired. </p>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Note that ordering is important for
        many mods. Reversing the order of some mods may cause problems.</span> </p>

    <p><em><strong>-Bugfixes, failsafes and safety additions.</strong></em><br>
      Added latest commit from Nullcascade regarding the MWSE 1024 plugin limit
      for the mod masters tab.<br>
      Fixed some pathing issues and fixed an issue with using the apostrophe
      character on renaming installers.<br>
      Added an information dialog to notify users of the new ability to enable
      MWSE 1024 plugin<br>
      Added switches on Greatness7 and NullCascade commits so that they may be
      enabled/disabled from the settings.<br>
      Implemented Greatness7 and NullCascade commits for supporting up to 1024
      plugins with MWSE .<br>
      Added an option in settings for enabling/disabling MWSE support of 1024
      plugins.<br>
      Reverted, temporarily, the new file-drop functionality in the Installers
      since it is conflicting with the internal drag and drop.<br>
      Fixed a bug in the Settings dialog which was not resizing the elements
      (options) correctly.<br>
      Updated the pickle implementation to use binary so it can be slightly more
      efficient, compatible with newer pickle protocols and it will (supposedly)
      minimize the EOF error which plagues many users (in all of Wrye Mash
      forks) in many instances. The change is implemented with being backward
      compatible with the older settings format (which after first execution
      gets upgraded). Pickle is also set to use the latest protocol available
      (also supposedly more efficient). Extra care has been taken to avoid
      corruption of any pickle file if an error occurs (unless it is
      catastrophic).<br>
      Fixed a regression bug with the "Installers" being enabled without user
      approval. (Thanks StormcloakViking)<br>
      Fixed a regression bug with the "Updaters" list not being loaded, late
      night mistakes... (Thanks KarmicKid)<br>
      Added a very fast Copy Tree class in Wrye Mash. It is currently used when
      Dragging and Dropping in the Installers but it will also be implemented
      elsewhere in the future.<br>
      Added Drag and Drop functionality for the Installers list. You may drag
      packages and folders directly on the Installers list to import them.<br>
      Added Ctrl+A and Ctrl+D to select/deselect all items in the Installers
      list.<br>
      Added a store/restore button set on the Installers tab, for
      storing/restoring Installers order. It will store the order of the
      installers and their active state. On restoring the order, a choice
      appears for the user to either sync the restored order, by re-installing
      the installers, or do nothing.<br>
      Refactored/optimized store/restore functionality for mod/plugins order.<br>
      All lists will focus now on mouse hover allowing to mouse scroll without
      clicking on them (user friendliness).<br>
      Cosmetic fixes and GUI user friendliness additions on the Installers tab.<br>
      Fixed a locale problem with wxpython. Tested with Korean locale but it
      should work with other locales also.<br>
      Credits updated.<br>
      Fixed/refactored/updated TES3CMD clean window. More stable and user
      friendly.<br>
      Fixed a bug which threw an exception when running saved custom commands.<br>
      Added Abot's "'tes3cmd.exe dump --raw-with-header dump.esp [selected
      files]'" option as "Merge with TES3CMD".<br>
      Added Abot's "Update header field and sync the list of masters." option as
      "Sync Masters".<br>
      Fixed a possible Unicode exception with when show logs of external
      programs (e.g: TES3CMD).<br>
      Fixed a possible freeze situation with "Fixit (all active)" and "Create

      use.<br>

      for their language from the settings.<br>
      Fixed some newly introduced bugs with the error messages.<br>
      Wrye Mash was saving, unnecessarily, twice the 'morrowind.ini' (or
      'openmw.cfg'). This is now fixed.<br>
      Reinforced a fail-safe which reverts to the last 'morrowind.ini' (or
      'openmw.cfg') backup in case of fatal errors.<br>
      Various encoding fail-safes.</p>

      Repair All vs. Repair Refs<br>
      Repair Refs no longer removes Orphan Contents. Instead...<br>
      New Repair All does Repair Refs, but also removes Orphan Contents and <br>

      previous games that are no longer associated with save game.<br>

      The remove objects by id function added to the CLI in version 0.38 is now
      available in the GUI.<br>
      Lock Times<br>
      Lock Times (formerly "Remember Times", formerly "Auto-set Times") will now
      forget memorized times if you turn it off. This prevents Lock Times from
      overriding changes made by other load ordering utilities.<br>

      Misc.<br>
      Rearrange Masters link list.</p>
    <p><b> 0.37 Window Closing Bugfix [3/13/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Closing While Minimized<br>
      Previously, if Mash were closed while minimized, it would save a bogus
      frame position in settings, which would prevent it from opening correctly
      on next use. This is fixed now. </p>
    <p><b>0.36 Misc. Improvements [2/25/2005]</b> </p>
    <p>Circular Masters Mash was going into infinite loop if masters were
      circular. This is fixed<br>
      now.<br>
      Sync to Load ESMs will no longer allow you to create circular masters.</p>

    <p><b> 0.34 ObjectIndex Mapping, Dialog Export/Import, Misc. Fixes
        [2/5/2005]</b></p>
    <p> ObjectIndex Remapping<br>
      Mash now does ObjectIndex remapping, thus completing its program for
      preventing/fixing doubling.<br>
      Dialog Export/Import<br>
      Can now export and import dialog.<br>
      Snapshot Modifications<br>
      Snapshot numbers can now only be preceded by a '-'.<br>
      Is Snapshot command has been removed.<br>
      Interior Cells with Water<br>
      Mash was misidentifying interior cells with water as exterior cells. This
      may have resulted in excessive reference deletion on repair. This is
      corrected now.</p>
    <p><b> 0.33 Minor Fixes and Improvements [1/29/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Minor Bugfixes<br>
      Mash was throwing an error when you right clicked on a master that didn't
      exist. This is fixed now.<br>
      Mash was throwing an error when you tried to "Load Masters" when one or
      more of the masters didn't exist. Mash now gives you a warning message.<br>
      Misc. Improvements<br>
      Add support for '+' at end of version numbers in descriptions (e.g., <br>
      "Version 1.2.3+". Use this as a note that file has changed since snapshot
      was taken.</p>
    <p><b> 0.32 Minor Bug Fix [1/27/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Bugfix: New Lines in Mod Descriptions <br>
      Mash was writing descriptions with unix style new lines when it should
      have been using windows style new lines. This is fixed now.<br>
      If you have a lot of files contaminated with this error, you can use the
      mish temp3 function to fix it. Ask on the forums for more info if you need
      it.<br>
      AFAIK, this produced no run time problems -- it just messed up your
      description display in TESCS. </p>
    <p><b>0.31 New Features, Minor Fixes [1/27/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Copy to Esm/Esp <br>
      You can now copy an esp to an esm and vice versa. Look for new command on
      Mod items context menu.<br>
      Editing Masters <br>
      Change menu item name from "Edit" to "Update".<br>
      No more warning if select from menu. But clicking anywhere in list will
      trigger Update query.<br>
      For esps/esms, change "Sync to Load Files" to "Sync to Load ESMs". <br>
      Can now directly "Sync to Load Files/ESMs". I.e., don't have to "Update<br>
      Masters" first.<br>
      Snapshot Improvements<br>
      New Is Snapshot command for versioned mods.<br>
      Version number is now written to description field if description has a
      pre-existing "Version N.M" line.<br>
      Minor Bug Fixes <br>
      Mash was failing to remove masters when the user attempted to uncheck them
      in the master list. This works now.<br>
      Miscellaneous <br>
      You can now sort mods by file version.<br>
      Mash now deletes backups and temp files while deleting files.
      However,&nbsp; it does not delete snapshots or hidden files.</p>
    <p><b> 0.30 Itty Bitty Fix [1/24/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Minor Bug Fix <br>
      Fix a key not found error that showed up on some Ref Repairs.</p>
    <p><b> 0.29 Misc. Improvements and Fixes [1/23/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Major Bug Fix: Refs Repair on Exterior Cells <br>
      Mash was misidentifying exterior cells, and as a result erroneously
      marking a change refs in those cells as BAD::NO MASTER, when they were
      fine. This is fixed now.<br>
      Repair Refs on Mods <br>
      You can now use Repair Refs on mods.<br>
      Also a (hopefully) rare bug on editing masters of esps has been fixed.<br>
      Improved Error Checking <br>
      Mash now checks read size for reasonableness before attempting to read.
      This fixes the slowness problem mentioned in File Corruption Handing for
      version 0.28.<br>
      During Repair Refs, Mash now generates useful error messages if a&nbsp;
      master needs to be repaired first.<br>
      Mash now checks for second NAM0 records in cells.<br>
      Minor Bug Fixes <br>
      Mash would sometimes crash if a mod file was deleted or renamed from
      outside Mash. It now handles handles this correctly.</p>
    <p><b> 0.28 Minor Fixes and Features [1/22/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Major Bug Fix <br>
      Mash was failing on manually unselecting files. (This is a recent "break
      something while fixing something" bug.) This is fixed now.<br>
      More File Corruption Handling <br>
      Added a new handler for another type of file corruption, but it seems to
      move pretty slowly (if such a corrupted file is present). Better than
      nothing, I guess.<br>
      Bugfix: Morrowind.ini <br>
      Mash could enter an infinite loop at startup if the Morrowind.ini file had
      been altered by hand in certain ways. <br>
      Now, Mash handle most (all?) legitimate changes to the Morrowind.ini file.
      However, a missing [Game Files] section will still result in a
      failure/exit on startup. </p>
    <p><b>0.27 Major Bugfix [1/21/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Bugfix: File Version <br>
      Mash was reading the file version in as a float, but writing it out as an
      int! This in fact, was the cause of the death animation problem as well as
      the character's attire becoming confused after header editing.<br>
      Now, Mash writes file version as a float and no longer uses the current
      animation deletion "fix" from version 0.26.<br>
      Also, Mash now displays file version in both mod and save details views.<br>
      Files with version 0.0 are mostly likely corrupted and should be reverted
      to backup or first backup.<br>
      Bugfix: Corrupted Headers <br>
      Mash crashed on startup if you had mod or save files with missing or
      corrupted headers.&nbsp; Now, Mash warns you and ignores the damaged
      files.<br>
      Bugfix: Y2038 Bug <br>
      Mash crashed on startup if you had files with modification dates greater
      than 1/19/2038 (Unix Epoch rollover! Welcome to Y2038!). Now, Mash resets
      the modification dates of those files to around 1/1/2037 and notifies you
      of the change.</p>
    <p><b>0.26 Major Bugfix [1/20/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Header Editing <br>
      Instead of blowing away all leveled creatures, I now blow away all current
      animations. This seems to be a full solution.<br>
      Drawbacks: NPCs may stand around for a little while before resuming their
      normal activities. Also, corpses will repeat their death animations.<br>
      Ref Repair <br>
      Fixed an MVRF bug before I saw it.<br>
      ESTemplate.ini <br>
      This is the Enchanted Editor template that I'm currently using. It has a
      number of additions related to save files. It has not been massively
      tested (but that's true for the original templates too, of course). Still,
      use at your own risk. Includes some additions from Beryllium as well.</p>
    <p><b> 0.25 Partial Bugfixes [1/19/2005]</b></p>
    <p> ESM Ordering <br>
      Reworked this in an effort to mimic Bethesda's ordering. Seems to be
      correct now...<br>
      Header Editing (Partial Bug Fix) <br>
      After editing headers, creature corpses are not able to find their death
      animations. Living creatures are fine, as are creatures that you kill
      after the editing. Also, it doesn't seem to be a problem for NPCS -- just
      for creatures.<br>
      As a temporary partial solution, I'm resetting all LVCR references. This
      is basically safe -- it will just cause those points to respawn. But this
      still leaves the problems of non-spawned creatures (many of whom are
      crucial to various quests.)<br>
      Repair Refs <br>
      Maintain original ordering of functions.<br>
      Note: This may also suffer from creature death animation bug.<br>
