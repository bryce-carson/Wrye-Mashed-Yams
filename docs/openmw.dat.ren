    <p><em><strong>-Bugfixes, failsafes and safety additions.</strong></em><br>
      Fixed a bug in mod order restore when an empty item was included in the
      list.<br>
      Added more encoding failsafes, for example when changing encodings, to
      abort any operations.<br>
      Added the ability to insert the datetime as a text in the datetime dialog
      (where you change the date and time of a mod).<br>
      Added a copy and a paste button next to the datetime field, on the mod
      details (right sidebar). You may use them if you wish to make a fast
      copy/paste of datetime between mods.<br>
      Wrye Mash will auto-correct capitalization (based on existing filenames)
      of OpenMW configuration entries.<br>
      Implemented de-duplication for esp, esm, bsa, omwgame, omwaddon for
      OpenMWconfig file entries.<br>
      Fixed BSA archives bugging out when no no Datamods folders are selected in
      OpenMW.<br>
      Fixed a BSA archive enumeration bug in the status bar.<br>
      Fixed OpenMW plugin extension parsing to be case insensitive.<br>
      Refactored and optimized OpenMW Data-mods implementation.<br>
      Fixed a bug where (in some scenarios) OpenMW config files were increasing
      by one empty line every time they were parsed.<br>
      Wrye Mash will auto-correct capitalization (based on existing filenames)
      of manual Morrowind configuration entries.<br>
      Implemented de-duplication for esp, esm, bsa for Morrowind config file
      entries.<br>
      Fixed some archaic problems with MashError exceptions.<br>
      Added a manual backup/restore menu option for Morrowind.ini (and
      OpenMW.cfg/pluginlist.json) (besides the automatic one).<br>
      Updated the profile engine.<br>
      Updated codec open with io.<br>
      Fixed the problems with special characters on multilingual morrowind.ini
      (Tested on French steam version) It should work with all translations
      (Russian, Polish, etc), but the user needs to select the correct encoding
      for their language from the settings.<br>
      Fixed some newly introduced bugs with the error messages.<br>
      Wrye Mash was saving, unnecessarily, twice the 'morrowind.ini' (or
      'openmw.cfg'). This is now fixed.<br>
      Reinforced a fail-safe which reverts to the last 'morrowind.ini' (or
      'openmw.cfg') backup in case of fatal errors.<br>
      Various encoding fail-safes.</p>
    <p><b>100 Polemos [</b><b><b>10/8/2019</b>]</b></p>
    <p><em><strong>-Mainly a bugfix and optimization version</strong></em><br>
      Added a notification when using Mashed Patch and having TES3cmd installed
      which suggests the use of Multipatch instead (User-friendly).<br>
      Implemented a self reset of "Updaters" data in case it gets corrupted
      (asks the user first).<br>
      TES3cmd is shown if it is detected correctly in the Paths section of the
      Settings dialog (to avoid user confusions).<br>
      TES3cmd was, in some cases, erroneously detected as active when it was
      outside "Data Files" folder, this is now fixed.<br>
      Refactored/optimised various wxpython dialogs.<br>
      Fixed the "Open..." option menu in the Installers to show information if
      no package is selected in Menubar or be disabled in the Old Menu.<br>
      Added a new menu option "Import Package.." which imports packages to the
      Installers directory (User-friendly).<br>
      Added the option to disable the new "7zip crc32 calculation on big files"
      in the settings (just in case).<br>
      Added a new "Advanced" tab on the settings dialog.<br>

      mark).<br>

      The action is cancelled before any changes are made.<br>
      Optimized installers full refresh. A full refresh of 1.34GB installers
      (and Data Files) takes 5.6 sec in my system<br>
      Implemented 7z crc32 calculation for big files. Depending on the size of
      the scanned files there is a 2%-20% speed increase.<br>
      Implemented xxhash algorithm in place of crc32 for installer packages (for
      the packages not their contents), which decreased by 30% the scan time of
      packages.<br>
      Fixed the toolbar not refreshing when editing mlox in the settings.<br>
      Mash will now try to revert to the backup settings configuration if
      settings.pkl is missing.<br>
      Structure refactoring.<br>
      Fixed a bug in Tes3lint implementation which was preventing to exit the
      output dialog.<br>
      Added a new Tab in the Settings dialog named "Defaults". In there you can
      enable/disable Mash warning prompts and also reset the column widths of
      Mash lists (e.g. Mods list) into their default widths).<br>
      Optimized and refactored the query dialogs for high resolutions.<br>
      Optimized conf backup (morrowind.ini or openmw.cfg) fail-safe
      auto-restoration.<br>
      Improved conf file saving for better compatibility with Morrowind/OpenMW.<br>
      Added a filename detection for possible problems with filename encodings.

      Mash first time use Wizard is now allowed to be resized.<br>
      Some code refactoring in the Mash Wizard also added encoding choices (for
      translated version of Morrowind).<br>
      Added a warning when changing masters with unknown encodings in a
      mod/plugin . The action is cancelled before any changes are made.<br>
      Added a warning when a master is automatically deselected in the masters
      list in saves and mod/plugins (when missing or of wrong encoding).<br>
      Fixed problem in masters list when a file contains unknown characters. It
      will not bug out but it will deselect the problematic master. (Thanks
      KarmicKid)<br>

      mods tab. (Thanks KarmicKid)<br>

      Added a check on open if there is already an instance of Wrye Mash
      running.<br>

      Code updates preparing transition to wxpython Phoenix.<br>
      Fixed another Unicode bug, (thanks movomo!).<br>
      Optimized "Full Refresh" speed in Installers by around 75%!! You got to
      see to believe it! It went from 23" to 5" in my system.<br>
      Added option to force close Wrye Mash if it is stuck ad infinitum in the
      debug log.<br>

      dialog (thanks Valascon).<br>
      Fixed an attribute overload bug in mod/bsa enumeration, (thanks Stahpk).<br>

      moving items with the Keyboard is supported on reversed lists. Bonus: I
      optimized keyboard movement on reversed lists, by reversing up/down
      arrows, try and see.<br>

      DEL in the installers tab.<br>

      theme". It only changes the lists font color though to black...<br>
      Created theme engine. For now, only the font color of lists can be changed
      and the font hover color.<br>

    <p><b> 0.37 Window Closing Bugfix [3/13/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Closing While Minimized<br>
      Previously, if Mash were closed while minimized, it would save a bogus
      frame position in settings, which would prevent it from opening correctly
      on next use. This is fixed now. </p>
    <p><b>0.36 Misc. Improvements [2/25/2005]</b> </p>
    <p>Circular Masters Mash was going into infinite loop if masters were

      Snapshot Modifications<br>

      Interior Cells with Water<br>
      Mash was misidentifying interior cells with water as exterior cells. This
      may have resulted in excessive reference deletion on repair. This is
      corrected now.</p>
    <p><b> 0.33 Minor Fixes and Improvements [1/29/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Minor Bugfixes<br>
      Mash was throwing an error when you right clicked on a master that didn't
      exist. This is fixed now.<br>
      Mash was throwing an error when you tried to "Load Masters" when one or
      more of the masters didn't exist. Mash now gives you a warning message.<br>
      Misc. Improvements<br>
      Add support for '+' at end of version numbers in descriptions (e.g., <br>
      "Version 1.2.3+". Use this as a note that file has changed since snapshot
      was taken.</p>
    <p><b> 0.32 Minor Bug Fix [1/27/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Bugfix: New Lines in Mod Descriptions <br>
      Mash was writing descriptions with unix style new lines when it should
      have been using windows style new lines. This is fixed now.<br>
      If you have a lot of files contaminated with this error, you can use the
      mish temp3 function to fix it. Ask on the forums for more info if you need
      it.<br>
      AFAIK, this produced no run time problems -- it just messed up your
      description display in TESCS. </p>
    <p><b>0.31 New Features, Minor Fixes [1/27/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Copy to Esm/Esp <br>
      You can now copy an esp to an esm and vice versa. Look for new command on
      Mod items context menu.<br>
      Editing Masters <br>
      Change menu item name from "Edit" to "Update".<br>
      No more warning if select from menu. But clicking anywhere in list will
      trigger Update query.<br>
      For esps/esms, change "Sync to Load Files" to "Sync to Load ESMs". <br>
      Can now directly "Sync to Load Files/ESMs". I.e., don't have to "Update<br>
      Masters" first.<br>
      Snapshot Improvements<br>
      New Is Snapshot command for versioned mods.<br>
      Version number is now written to description field if description has a
      pre-existing "Version N.M" line.<br>
      Minor Bug Fixes <br>
      Mash was failing to remove masters when the user attempted to uncheck them
      in the master list. This works now.<br>
      Miscellaneous <br>
      You can now sort mods by file version.<br>
      Mash now deletes backups and temp files while deleting files.
      However,&nbsp; it does not delete snapshots or hidden files.</p>
    <p><b> 0.30 Itty Bitty Fix [1/24/2005]</b></p>

      Fix a key not found error that showed up on some Ref Repairs.</p>
    <p><b> 0.29 Misc. Improvements and Fixes [1/23/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Major Bug Fix: Refs Repair on Exterior Cells <br>
      Mash was misidentifying exterior cells, and as a result erroneously
      marking a change refs in those cells as BAD::NO MASTER, when they were
      fine. This is fixed now.<br>
      Repair Refs on Mods <br>
      You can now use Repair Refs on mods.<br>
      Also a (hopefully) rare bug on editing masters of esps has been fixed.<br>
      Improved Error Checking <br>
      Mash now checks read size for reasonableness before attempting to read.
      This fixes the slowness problem mentioned in File Corruption Handing for
      version 0.28.<br>
      During Repair Refs, Mash now generates useful error messages if a&nbsp;
      master needs to be repaired first.<br>
      Mash now checks for second NAM0 records in cells.<br>
      Minor Bug Fixes <br>
      Mash would sometimes crash if a mod file was deleted or renamed from
      outside Mash. It now handles handles this correctly.</p>
    <p><b> 0.28 Minor Fixes and Features [1/22/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Major Bug Fix <br>
      Mash was failing on manually unselecting files. (This is a recent "break
      something while fixing something" bug.) This is fixed now.<br>
      More File Corruption Handling <br>
      Added a new handler for another type of file corruption, but it seems to
      move pretty slowly (if such a corrupted file is present). Better than
      nothing, I guess.<br>
      Bugfix: Morrowind.ini <br>
      Mash could enter an infinite loop at startup if the Morrowind.ini file had
      been altered by hand in certain ways. <br>
      Now, Mash handle most (all?) legitimate changes to the Morrowind.ini file.
      However, a missing [Game Files] section will still result in a
      failure/exit on startup. </p>
    <p><b>0.27 Major Bugfix [1/21/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Bugfix: File Version <br>
      Mash was reading the file version in as a float, but writing it out as an
      int! This in fact, was the cause of the death animation problem as well as
      the character's attire becoming confused after header editing.<br>
      Now, Mash writes file version as a float and no longer uses the current
      animation deletion "fix" from version 0.26.<br>
      Also, Mash now displays file version in both mod and save details views.<br>
      Files with version 0.0 are mostly likely corrupted and should be reverted
      to backup or first backup.<br>
      Bugfix: Corrupted Headers <br>
      Mash crashed on startup if you had mod or save files with missing or
      corrupted headers.&nbsp; Now, Mash warns you and ignores the damaged
      files.<br>
      Bugfix: Y2038 Bug <br>
      Mash crashed on startup if you had files with modification dates greater
      than 1/19/2038 (Unix Epoch rollover! Welcome to Y2038!). Now, Mash resets
      the modification dates of those files to around 1/1/2037 and notifies you
      of the change.</p>
    <p><b>0.26 Major Bugfix [1/20/2005]</b></p>
    <p> Header Editing <br>
      Instead of blowing away all leveled creatures, I now blow away all current
      animations. This seems to be a full solution.<br>
      Drawbacks: NPCs may stand around for a little while before resuming their
      normal activities. Also, corpses will repeat their death animations.<br>
      Ref Repair <br>
      Fixed an MVRF bug before I saw it.<br>
      ESTemplate.ini <br>
      This is the Enchanted Editor template that I'm currently using. It has a
      number of additions related to save files. It has not been massively
      tested (but that's true for the original templates too, of course). Still,
      use at your own risk. Includes some additions from Beryllium as well.</p>
    <p><b> 0.25 Partial Bugfixes [1/19/2005]</b></p>
    <p> ESM Ordering <br>
      Reworked this in an effort to mimic Bethesda's ordering. Seems to be
      correct now...<br>
      Header Editing (Partial Bug Fix) <br>
      After editing headers, creature corpses are not able to find their death
      animations. Living creatures are fine, as are creatures that you kill
      after the editing. Also, it doesn't seem to be a problem for NPCS -- just
      for creatures.<br>
      As a temporary partial solution, I'm resetting all LVCR references. This
      is basically safe -- it will just cause those points to respawn. But this
      still leaves the problems of non-spawned creatures (many of whom are
      crucial to various quests.)<br>
      Repair Refs <br>
      Maintain original ordering of functions.<br>
      Note: This may also suffer from creature death animation bug.<br>
